# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Do not open a public issue for a security problem.**

Report it privately via [GitHub's private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/GetPayin-Tech/paylink-python/security/advisories/new), or email **tech@getpayin.com**.

Please include the SDK version, a description of the impact, and a reproduction if you have one. We aim to acknowledge within 3 business days.

## Supported versions

The latest minor release receives security fixes. Because the SDK is pre-1.0, patches are published against the newest version only.

## Handling credentials

This SDK is **server-side only**.

- `hash_token` is a signing secret. It must never reach a browser, a mobile app, or any client bundle. Anyone holding it can forge requests and webhooks for your integration.
- `public_token` identifies the integration and is sent on every request. It is not secret, but it is not a substitute for the signing secret either.
- Load both from environment variables or a secret manager. Never commit them.

`repr(client)` does not include the `hash_token`, so it stays out of logs and tracebacks that render the client. That is a safety net, not a licence to log the config.

## Things this SDK does not do for you

- **Webhook replay protection.** PayLink webhook signatures carry no timestamp or nonce, so a valid payload stays valid forever. Signature verification proves authenticity, not freshness. Pair `webhooks.verify()` with your own idempotency keyed on `invoice_id`.
- **PCI scope reduction.** `vcc.charge` and `cards.tokenize` accept raw PAN and CVV. Sending real card data through your server puts that server in PCI scope. Prefer the hosted checkout (`invoices.create`) or card tokens where possible.
- **Error redaction.** `PaylinkApiError.raw` holds the API's response body verbatim so failures stay debuggable. If you forward errors to a third-party log or APM, review what that body can contain for your integration.
